Melen's version of seamstress ased on Latane's work, changes from his original scripts can be found here with date of changes

10/22/25:
    Ran the whole install process on my computer, had to do some modifications to make it work
        -Had to pip install a bunch of stuff not included in the setup procedure
        -Removed the try-expect block for the import of the penn otherwise library was not imported idk why in src_extrqctor.py.
        -Removed import of dtw functions, there are some issues while importing the package, error is  "No module named 'gdtwcpp'", probably easy to fix but I don't need it rn, so I commented the section. 
        I'll work on that later.
        -added sys.path.append("../")

        In apply_perturbation()
        Latane was doing multiple interpolation, I couldn't understand the reason behind that, I modified it to only one. Feels like it's better but we will need to discuss
        I noticed an issue with time series of time in .wav files. I've got no clue why as of now, but last time is doubled at the end for no apparent reason. 
        Feels like it's the case on all files. Working on a way to fix this issue computationaly-wise but it's raising questions. We wll have to talk about that.

10/23/25:
    Trying to make dilation mamipulation more straightforward, there are currently 3 timing in the script. onset of manipulation, window, magnitude. I can't get my head around all that especially for duration manipulation
10/24/25:
    Created new function dilate, that is specially designed for duration manipulation, possible to include in original function by Latane but wasn't sure this was the best solution
    I removed the last time 
10/28/25:
    Creation of a function to do multiple dilations in one sweep successive_dilation
10/29/25:
    successive_dilation is working and .wav signal can be synthetized from it
11/14/25:
    Created a new notebook Julia_nb to make modifications of an audio signal more straightforward. Added 2 new functions, one dealing with pitch+intensity shifts, another one dealing with the application of multiple transformation
    I wanted all perturbations to be entered in original signal timing meaning that all dilation of time arrives after all perturbations of pitch or intensity.
    Otherwise, order of dilation would have changed the output, which is not desirable.
12/1/25:
    -Created a new notebook to perform duration and prominence modifications sequentially and seperately. It is less computationally optimized but maybe more biologicaly valid and will help us pinpoint exactly the consequence of different manipulations
    -Made my script compatible with Julia's output format, with the new routines, we can generate audio from a dictionary, sparc and audio recordings of unaccentuated words (could be syllables too, but now it's words)
    -Currently cleaning the julia_nb_latversion
